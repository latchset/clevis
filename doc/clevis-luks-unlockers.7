.SH OVERVIEW
.PP
Clevis provides unlockers for LUKS volumes which can use LUKS policy:
.IP \[bu] 2
clevis\-luks\-unlock \- Unlocks manually using the command line.
.IP \[bu] 2
dracut \- Unlocks automatically during early boot.
.IP \[bu] 2
systemd \- Unlocks automatically during late boot.
.IP \[bu] 2
udisks2 \- Unlocks automatically in a GNOME desktop session.
.PP
Once a LUKS volume is bound using \f[C]clevis\ luks\ bind\f[], it can be
unlocked using any of the above unlockers without using a password.
.SH MANUAL UNLOCKING
.PP
You can unlock a LUKS volume manually using the following command:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$\ sudo\ clevis\ luks\ unlock\ \-d\ /dev/sda
\f[]
.fi
.PP
For more information, see \f[C]clevis\-luks\-unlock\f[](1).
.SH EARLY BOOT UNLOCKING
.PP
If Clevis integration does not already ship in your initramfs, you may
need to rebuild your initramfs with this command:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$\ sudo\ dracut\ \-f
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Once Clevis is integrated into your initramfs, a simple reboot should
unlock your root volume.
Note, however, that early boot integration only works for the root
volume.
Non\-root volumes should use the late boot unlocker.
.PP
Dracut will bring up your network using DHCP by default.
If you need to specify additional network parameters, such as static IP
configuration, please consult the dracut documentation.
.SH LATE BOOT UNLOCKING
.PP
You can enable late boot unlocking by executing the following command:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$\ sudo\ systemctl\ enable\ clevis\-luks\-askpass.path
\f[]
.fi
.PP
After a reboot, Clevis will attempt to unlock all \f[C]_netdev\f[]
devices listed in \f[C]/etc/crypttab\f[] when systemd prompts for their
passwords.
This implies that systemd support for \f[C]_netdev\f[] is required.
.SH DESKTOP UNLOCKING
.PP
When the udisks2 unlocker is installed, your GNOME desktop session
should unlock LUKS removable devices configured with Clevis
automatically.
You may need to restart your desktop session after installation for the
unlocker to be loaded.
