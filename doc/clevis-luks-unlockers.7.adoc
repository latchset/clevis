== NAME

clevis-luks-unlockers - Overview of clevis luks unlockers

== OVERVIEW

Clevis provides unlockers for LUKS volumes which can use LUKS policy:

  * clevis-luks-unlock - Unlocks manually using the command line.
  * dracut - Unlocks automatically during early boot.
  * systemd - Unlocks automatically during late boot.
  * udisks2 - Unlocks automatically in a GNOME desktop session.

Once a LUKS volume is bound using *clevis luks bind*, it can be unlocked using
any of the above unlockers without using a password.

== MANUAL UNLOCKING

You can unlock a LUKS volume manually using the following command:

    $ sudo clevis luks unlock -d /dev/sda

For more information, see link:clevis-luks-unlock.1.adoc[*clevis-luks-unlock*(1)].

== EARLY BOOT UNLOCKING

If Clevis integration does not already ship in your initramfs, you may need to
rebuild your initramfs with this command:

    $ sudo dracut -f

Once Clevis is integrated into your initramfs, a simple reboot should unlock
your root volume. Note, however, that early boot integration only works for the
root volume. Non-root volumes should use the late boot unlocker.

Dracut will bring up your network using DHCP by default. If you need to specify
additional network parameters, such as static IP configuration, please consult
the dracut documentation.

== LATE BOOT UNLOCKING

You can enable late boot unlocking by executing the following command:

    $ sudo systemctl enable clevis-luks-askpass.path

After a reboot, Clevis will attempt to unlock all *_netdev* devices listed in
*/etc/crypttab* when systemd prompts for their passwords. This implies that
systemd support for *_netdev* is required.

== DESKTOP UNLOCKING

When the udisks2 unlocker is installed, your GNOME desktop session should
unlock LUKS removable devices configured with Clevis automatically. You may
need to restart your desktop session after installation for the unlocker to be
loaded.
