*clevis luks regen* -d DEV -s SLT

== OVERVIEW

The *clevis luks regen* command regenerates the LUKS metadata for a given slot in a LUKS device. It effectively
performs an operation equivalent to *clevis luks unbind* and *clevis luks bind* for rebinding said slot and device.

== OPTIONS

* *-d* _DEV_ :
  The bound LUKS device

* *-s* _SLT_ :
  The slot or key slot number for rebinding. Note that it requires that such slot is currently bound by clevis.

    # clevis luks regen -d /dev/sda1 -s 1
